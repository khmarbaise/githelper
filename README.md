# Status

The current state of development is `Prototype`.

* Scenario
  * Branch can be merged into main via `gjh gmc`
  * Branch can be pushed --force-with-lease `gjh pwl`

# Overview



## Basic Idea

Currently I use a lot of shell scripts which help me a lot about my daily
task.

First step using go-git.
First working example with checkout to master.


## TODO


Another scenario
```shell
$ (BRX)$ pwd
$ (BRX)$ git st
On branch BRX
Your branch is based on 'origin/BRX', but the upstream is gone.
(use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
